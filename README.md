### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Rebecca, a data scientist with a background in myrmecology, the study of ants. I love to analyze data, build tools, illustrate, design, and visualize the things I learn from data.

**Data Science Every Day**
<br>I'm working with Brown Girl Surf as a data scientist! I have volunteered as a surf instructor and worked in several roles at BGS since 2016. I also <br>brew all the beer for BGS events.
<br>At Brown Girl Surf I:
- Write algorithms for financial tools.
- Design, improve, implement, and analyze surveys and survey results to improve our ability to meet community needs and to understand program impacts.
- Create reports for grant applications, advisory meetings, and public forums using an events and sales database I assembled.
- Illustrate, design, and produce visual aids that relate our organizations values.
